# Track Order Chatbot

A smart, conversational chatbot built to help users easily track their product orders in real-time. This project demonstrates the integration of natural language processing with order management logic to simulate a customer service assistant.

##  Features

-  Track order status by order ID
-  Friendly conversational flow using chatbot logic
-  NLP-based user input handling
-  Predefined intents and fallback responses
-  Easily extendable for e-commerce or logistics use cases

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 
- Dialogflow (or custom rule-based NLP)
- Flask (optional for deployment as API)
- JSON for intents and response management

##  Folder Structure

\`\`\`
Track_Order_Chatbot/
├── intents/               # Contains predefined user intents and responses
├── chatbot.py             # Main chatbot script

##  How It Works

1. User asks a query like "Where is my order?"
2. Chatbot extracts the order ID (if available)
3. Responds with a simulated order status like "Out for delivery" or "Delivered"
4. Fallback response for unknown intents
